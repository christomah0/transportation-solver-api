# ðŸšš Transportation Solver API

This Spring Boot-based REST API solves the classic Transportation Problem using the Least Cost Method and the Modified Distribution Method (MODI). It calculates the most cost-effective way to transport goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations.

## **Base URL**

http://localhost:8080 (assuming the application is running locally on port 8080\)

## **Endpoint**

### **POST /api/solve**

This endpoint is used to solve a transportation problem by providing the costs, supply, and demand data. It returns the optimal allocation plan and the total minimum cost.

#### **Request**

* **Method**: POST  
* **Content-Type**: application/json  
* **Body**: A JSON object with the following structure:  
  | Field | Type | Description (The following is a list of the 20 most frequently asked questions about the Transportation Problem Solver API, along with their answers.)


* **What is the purpose of this API?**  
   This API solves the classic Transportation Problem, which aims to find the most cost-effective way to transport goods from various sources (e.g., factories) to different destinations (e.g., warehouses), given their respective supplies, demands, and unit transportation costs.


* **What algorithm does this API use?**  
   The API uses the Modified Distribution (MODI) method to find the optimal solution, starting with an Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS) generated by the Least Cost Method.  

### **API Request Body Example**

```json
{
  "costs": [
    [24, 22, 61, 49, 83, 35],
    [23, 39, 78, 28, 65, 42],
    [67, 56, 92, 24, 53, 54],
    [71, 43, 91, 67, 40, 49]
  ],
  "supply": [18, 32, 14, 9],
  "demand": [9, 11, 28, 6, 14, 5]
}
```
